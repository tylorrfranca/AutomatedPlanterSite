# Background Music Setup

To add background music to the PI page:

1. Download the audio from the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHEKplaCnXQ
2. Convert it to MP3 format
3. Save it as `background-music.mp3` in this directory
4. Optionally, also save as `background-music.ogg` for better browser compatibility

The audio will automatically play and loop when users visit the PI page.

- Name: `background-music.mp3` and/or `background-music.ogg`
- Location: `/public/audio/` directory
