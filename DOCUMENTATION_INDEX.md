## üéØ Quick Navigation by Task

### "I want to test if it's working"
‚Üí `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` section "Quick Start"  
‚Üí Run `python3 test_sensor_update.py`

### "I need to tell my friend what to do"
‚Üí Give them `PI_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`  
‚Üí Also share `SENSOR_FILE_INTEGRATION.md` for details

### "I want to understand how it works"
‚Üí `README_INTEGRATION.md` section "How It Works"  
‚Üí `FINAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for technical details

### "I need to troubleshoot"
‚Üí `README_INTEGRATION.md` section "Common Issues"  
‚Üí `FINAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` section "Troubleshooting"

### "I want to see the JSON format"
‚Üí Any guide! They all show it, but `PI_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` is quickest

## üóëÔ∏è What Was Removed

These outdated files were deleted:
- ‚ùå `example-raspberry-pi-client.py` - Used old HTTP POST method
- ‚ùå `RASPBERRY_PI_INTEGRATION.md` - Described old POST API
- ‚ùå `test-sensor-api.sh` - Tested POST endpoint (no longer exists)
- ‚ùå `pi-setup-instructions.md` - Outdated setup
- ‚ùå `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Redundant
- ‚ùå `SENSOR_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Redundant

## ‚úÖ Current System

Your website uses a **JSON file + automatic database** approach:

1. Pi writes to `public/sensor_data.json`
2. Website reads file every 5 seconds
3. Website auto-saves to database when file changes
4. Frontend displays real-time + historical data

Simple, reliable, and works great! üå±
